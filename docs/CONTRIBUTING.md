# Welcome!
Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Public Health Data Infrastructure (PHDI) project, part of the CDC's Pandemic-Ready Interoperability Modernization Effort (PRIME), a multi-year collaboration between CDC and the U.S. Digital Service (USDS) to strengthen data quality and information technology systems in state and local health departments. There are many ways to contribute, including writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests, and writing code for PRIME itself.

Before contributing, we encourage you to read our [README](README.md) and [LICENSE](LICENSE.MD) also found in this repository. If you have any questions that aren't answered in this repository, feel free to [contact us](mailto:prime@cdc.gov).

## Bug reports

If you think you found a bug in PHDI, search our [issues list](https://github.com/CDCgov/phdi-azure/issues) in case someone has opened a similar issue. We'll close duplicate issues to help keep our backlog neat and tidy.

It's very helpful if you can prepare a reproduction of the bug. In other words, provide a small test case that we can run to confirm your bug. This makes it easier to find and fix the problem.

## Contributing code and documentation changes

If you want to contribute a new feature or a bug fix, we ask that you follow a few guidelines. We have a dedicated team of engineers and support staff that works on this project on a daily basis, and following these steps ensures new pieces are interoperable, with no duplicated effort.

* Before you get started, look for an issue you want to work on. Please make sure this issue is not currently assigned to someone else. If there's no existing issue for your idea, please open one. We use the `good first issue` label to mark the problems we think are suitable for new contributors, so that's a good place to start.
* Once you select an issue, please discuss your idea for the fix or implementation in the comments for that issue. It's possible that someone else may have a plan for the issue that the team has discussed, or that there's context you should know before starting implementation. There are often several ways to fix a problem, and it's essential to find the right approach before spending time on a pull request (PR) that can't be merged.
* Once we've discussed your approach and everything looks good, we'll give you formal approval to begin development. Please don't start your development work before you get approval. We don't want you to waste your time on an issue if someone is already hard at work on it, or if there's something else in the way!

### Fork and clone the repository

You need to fork the main code or documentation repository and clone it to your local machine. See
[github help page](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) for help. 

Create a branch for your work. 

If you need to base your work on someone else's branch, talk to the branch owner.  

### Coding your changes

As you code, please make sure you add proper comments, documentation, and unit tests. PHDI adheres to strict quality guidelines, regardless of whether a contributing engineer is on the team or external. Please also ensure that you thoroughly test your changes on your local machine before submitting.

#### Commenting guidelines
Commenting is an important part of writing code other people can easily understand (including your future self!). While each developer has a unique style when it comes to writing comments, we have a few guidelines that govern the project, outlined below.
