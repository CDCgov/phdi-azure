    "### What Went Wrong\n",
    "Here, the algorithm was unable to separate the child from their parent of the same name. An examination of the birthdate and MRN field shows why. In all patients, the MRN field is missing entirely. We know that MRN is one of the best discriminative separators of patients, so in a close call like this, missing that information makes it difficult for the algorithm to correctly block the parent and child separately. Further, the birthdates of the child and their same-name parent are extremely similar. Both begin with a `19`, have a `0` in the 5th position, and contain a transposed `1` in the second to last column. The Jaro-Winkler similarity metric gives additional weight to strings that start the same and have common characters, meaning that these birthdates look mathematically similar enough that the algorithm considered them a match. If the birthdates were more different--such as the child being born after the year 2000, or in a different enough month-day combination--the algorithm would have judged the birthdays different enough to not match them. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposed Fix\n",
    "Given the importance of this parent-child edge case, we propose a post-processing heuristic that will apply a more granular filter to birthdates for the case when multiple people of the same name live at the same address. Rather than fuzzy match these birthdays with the same threshold as a more general case, we will increase the scoring threshold required to match on birthday, so that even if the first names are similar, that won't be enough to classify two patients as the same."

    "As odd as it may sound, from the algorithm's point of view, nothing. The last record in this block may have the same name and and birthdate as the previous duplicate records, but its address line and even its city is completely different. Further, there is no provided MRN to connect these individuals across different cities. However, data collection and representation among vulnerable populations can often be incomplete, so we can't rely on MRN to differentiate patients with transient housing or other instability. Moreover, while the algorithm sees the values `PT STATES HOMELESS` and `123 DEFAULT ST` as both real and distinct, we know better. Both of these are merely \"default\" placeholder values representing housing instability. Therefore, they shouldn't really be treated as different for the purposes of linking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposed Fix\n",
    "Much like the edge case involving a child with the same name as a parent, our proposed solution here is a stronger incorporation of post-processing checks. Instead of simply checking whether two incoming addresses are \"different,\" we propose to implement some more intelligent \"default\" checking into the linkage algorithm. That way, when two patients are being compared and are found to have these default or placeholder values, we can apply more granular criteria on the information that is provided, such as name and date of birth. We would love to discuss the details of the post-processing LAC is currently doing so that we can intelligently incorporate it into our solution."
